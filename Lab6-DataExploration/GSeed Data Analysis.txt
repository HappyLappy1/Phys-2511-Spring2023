Leaving on a train in a little bit, didn't get nearly as much out of this as I wanted to, but I think I still completed the assignment.

Anyway, the bar plot demonstrates a skew towards Sunday data (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, etc.), which is a reflection of my data collection process:
Not only did I have more time to collect data on Sunday, but I actively sought out data donors on Sunday, because the buyables are more complex and varied on Sunday specifically.

The box plots demonstrate version-dependence for lottery number ranges. "Old" Lottery numbers have a maximum of 65535, while new ones have a max of 99999.

My two scatter plots demonstrate a correlation between the Group Seed and Daily Seed for each entry. The first plot displays data collected from debug copies of the game.
These debug entries have a perfect linear correlation between Group Seed and Daily Seed. There is generally no distinction. Furthermore, Debug group seeds are 64 bit, while normal group seeds are 32 bit.
I also collected significantly less debug than I did normal group seed data. Normal group seed data is almost linear, except for a sign change halfway through. Seems that daily seeds are generally the absolute value of group seeds.

Finally, the pie charts reveal information about the game progress of my sample size: An overwhelming majority of them had claimed the national dex, and obtained the TM for defog. 
And about half of them had 8 badges. I intentionally searched for participants with low badge counts to round out my data, and the defog TM discovery occurred very late in my data collection process. 
Also, my data came from here, I collected it myself, and compiled it in this view-only google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgRaKukh3i_j0lX1pFv5i5wUeeg3AO5NaUwDRtPlWno/edit#gid=42529558
I heavily commented segments of my code with further information, I suggest checking that out too!
