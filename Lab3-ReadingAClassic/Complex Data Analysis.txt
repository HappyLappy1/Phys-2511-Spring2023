the creature evidently went on quite a large journey, rampaging from country to country.
	In chapter 1, Italy is mentioned extensively. Perhaps Victor, Caroline, Elizabeth, or another character spent time in Italy.
	
	Chapters 3 to 8, and chapter 11 mention Ingolstadt to a significant degree. A quick google search reveals that Ingolstadt is in Baravia,
Germany. Germany itself is NOT referenced anywhere in the text, so it has nothing to do with the setting itself. A character (might be Elizabeth) is likely from Ingolstadt. 
Furthermore, words such as Moritz (has ties to Germany, but a google search proved inconclusive) are scattered throughout the novel. 
	
	The Alps and Switzerland overlap considerably in the text, implying that they are often used together, rather than referring to the country and the mountains separately.
	
	Lacey, Safie, and Turk appear to spike dramatically at chapter 14. I was unable to interpret "Safie", but De Lacey is almost certainly Turkish.
Leghorn, Paris, and Arabian also peak in chapter 14, so maybe De Lacey is a Turk who immigrated elsewhere, with this Safie in tow.
Leghorn is a port in Italy, known by a different name, "Livorno", in the modern era.

	In Chapter 15, 17, and 24, Heaven is referenced. Perhaps this is when characters actually died, and the simple text file is mistaken.
	
	London peaks in Chapter 19, and the data does not suggest a reason outside of it being a part of the setting of that chapter.
